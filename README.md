# Batou
A dark, moody theme inspired by Batouâ€™s car and the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell.
Muted greys and cold blues echo the cyberpunk tone and tactical precision of Section 9.
Designed for omarchy.org with a focus on clarity, depth, and minimal distraction.

Theme created with aether https://github.com/bjarneo/aether <br>
